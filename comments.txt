# 1️⃣ Load the dataset
# Read the CSV file "customer-Churn.csv" into a pandas DataFrame named 'df'.
df = pd.read_csv("customer-Churn.csv")
# Print the shape (number of rows and columns) of the DataFrame.
print(f"Dataset shape: {df.shape}")
# Print the first 5 rows of the DataFrame to get a quick overview of the data.
print(df.head())

# 2️⃣ Basic cleaning of data
# Drop the 'customerID' column as it's a unique identifier and not useful for prediction. The 'axis=1' specifies that we are dropping a column, and 'inplace=True' modifies the DataFrame directly.
df.drop("customerID", axis=1, inplace=True)

# Convert the 'TotalCharges' column to a numeric data type. 'errors="coerce"' will turn any non-numeric values into NaN (Not a Number).
df["TotalCharges"] = pd.to_numeric(df["TotalCharges"], errors="coerce")

# Fill any missing values (NaN) in the entire DataFrame with 0.
df.fillna(0, inplace=True)

# 3️⃣ Encode categorical variables
# Convert categorical columns into numerical dummy/indicator variables. 'drop_first=True' drops the first category of each feature to avoid multicollinearity.
df_encoded = pd.get_dummies(df, drop_first=True)

# 4️⃣ Split into features (X) and target (y)
# Create a new DataFrame 'X' containing all columns except 'Churn_Yes', which will be our features.
X = df_encoded.drop("Churn_Yes", axis=1)
# Create a Series 'y' containing only the 'Churn_Yes' column, which will be our target variable.
y = df_encoded["Churn_Yes"]

# 5️⃣ Train-test split
# Split the data into training and testing sets. 80% of the data will be used for training, and 20% for testing. 'random_state=42' ensures that the split is reproducible.
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# 6️⃣ Train a Logistic Regression model
# Create an instance of the Logistic Regression model. 'max_iter=1000' increases the number of iterations for the model to converge.
model = LogisticRegression(max_iter=1000)
# Train the model using the training data.
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# 7️⃣ Predictions (predict)
# Use the trained model to make predictions on the test set.
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# 8️⃣ Evaluation
# Print the confusion matrix, a table that shows the number of correct and incorrect predictions made by the classification model compared to the actual outcomes.
print("\nConfusion Matrix:")
print(confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred))
# Print the classification report, which provides key metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score for each class.
print("\nClassification Report:")
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))

# 9️⃣ Simple EDA visualization
# Create a new figure with a specified size .
plt.figure(figsize=(6,4))
# Create a count plot to visualize the distribution of the 'Churn' column.
sns.countplot(x="Churn", data=df)
# Set the title of the plot.
plt.title("Customer Churn Distribution")
# Display the plot.
plt.show()

# Create a new figure with a specified size.
plt.figure(figsize=(6,4))
# Create a box plot to show the distribution of 'MonthlyCharges' for each 'Churn' category.
sns.boxplot(x="Churn", y="MonthlyCharges", data=df)
# Set the title of the plot.
plt.title("Monthly Charges by Churn Status")
# Display the plot.
plt.show()
